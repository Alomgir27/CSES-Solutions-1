# CSES Solutions

Original solutions to the CSES Problem Set, written in C++.

The CSES Problem Set is a collection of competitive programming practice problems. The goal of the project is to create a comprehensive high quality problem set for learning competitive programming. The current collection has 200 problems, and new problems will be gradually added. See the problem set [here](https://cses.fi/problemset/).

As of December 25th, the following number of solutions have been completed:
